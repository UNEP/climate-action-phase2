That means cutting emissions from transport and industry, managing land and resources more efficiently, building smart cities and curbing deforestation and food waste."

The world’s wealthiest 1 percent emit more than twice the emissions of the poorest half combined. As developing countries grow their economies, they need financial assistance and technical support to transition to low-carbon and resilient strategies. We can reduce emissions while growing the economy. The energy sector alone can cut emissions by 12.5 gigatonnes annually by switching to renewable energy and using its power more efficiently."
