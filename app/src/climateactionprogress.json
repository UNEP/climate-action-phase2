To limit this to 1.5°C, we need to cut emissions by 30 gigatones annually by 2030. That means cutting emissions from transport and industry, managing land and resources more efficiently, building smart cities and curbing deforestation and food waste. The world has to move towards net-zero emissions soon - and start moving now."
