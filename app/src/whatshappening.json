Air pollution and climate change are closely linked as all major pollutants have an impact on the climate and most share common sources with greenhouse gases. Improving our air quality will bring health, more net development and environmental benefits, along with mitigating climate change."

That means cutting emissions from transport and industry, managing land and resources more efficiently, building smart cities and curbing deforestation and food waste."

As developing countries grow their economies, they need financial assistance and technical support to transition to low-carbon, resilient strategies. It is possible to reduce emissions and grow economies. For example the energy sector can cut emissions by 12.5 gigatonnes annually by switching to renewable energy and being more efficient with the power it consumes."

This is far above what is needed to achieve the 2015 Paris Agreement goals of limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing 1.5°C. The good news is that the technologies already exist, including renewable power, green hydrogen and modern bioenergy. The COVID-19 crisis offers a chance to direct recovery measures towards low-carbon, green policies."
